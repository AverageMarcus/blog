title: My Recommended Kubernetes Resources for Newbies
tags: Kubernetes K8s
summary: |
  Recently, a friend of mine asked me what resources I'd recommend to start learning about Kubernetes. He was a victim of the layoffs that seem to be so prevalent right now and has experience as a classic SysOps / SysAdmin engineer but no expose to Kubernetes yet and wanted to learn to help improve his job-hunting prospects.

  I wasn't sure what to recommend at first, it's been a long time since I was learning Kubernetes for the first time and wasn't sure what was still useful and relevant but what follows is what I ended up sharing with him, and now with all of you.

* [Cloud Native Rejekts](https://cloud-native.rejekts.io/) is recent favourite of mine and is set up as the "b-side" conference to KubeCon. This great, community focussed conference runs for 2 days before the main KubeCon conference.
