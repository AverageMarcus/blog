I've been using Scaleway's [Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/) managed Kubernetes offering for my personal projects for a while now (this blog is running on it) so I was pretty excited when they announced a new managed Kubernetes offering dubbed [Kosmos](https://blog.scaleway.com/k8s-multi-cloud/). What makes Kosmos _really_ interesting is it's sold as a multi-cloud Kubernetes offering.

> Kubernetes Kosmos is the first-ever managed Kubernetes engine, allowing you to attach an instance or dedicated server from any cloud provider to a Scalewayâ€™s Kubernetes control plane.
>
> With Kubernetes Kosmos, you can:
>
> * Deploy clusters across multiple providers
> * Attach nodes from any cloud providers
> * Benefit from scalability & stability of cross-provider infrastructure
> * Access a fully managed & redundant Control Plane
>

This is quite a powerful approach as it allows the user to take advantage of the best functionality of each cloud provider on offer. But on top of that you are able to use a managed control plane with your on-premise instances.

This is all made possible thanks to the [Kilo](https://github.com/squat/kilo) project that's built on top of WireGuard to provide multi-cloud networking.

## Let's give it a try

Creation of a Kosmos cluster is a fairly easy process via the Scalway web console. Select the cluster type you want to create (Kosmos), the region to deploy into and the version of Kubernetes you want to use.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

</figure>

You also have the option of giving your cluster a name, description and some tags to differentiate it from any other clusters you may have.

During the initial creation you have the option of adding a Scaleway managed node pool. You can choose to skip this and instead set up your node pools later.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![Cluster Creating](/images/kosmos/CreationInProgress.png)

<figcaption>The cluster will take a few moments to become ready</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the cluster has finished creating and is ready to use you can add more node pools. One thing I did find interesting when adding a second Scaleway managed node pool was I could pick a different region to what my cluster was deployed into.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![Node pools in two different regions](/images/kosmos/MultiRegionPools.png)

<figcaption>Two node pools in two different regions</figcaption>
</figure>

Above you can see two node pools, the one called default I created along with the Kosmos cluster, the other was created after in a different region to the control plane. So far we have a multi-region Kubernetes cluster.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

## Multi-cloud

Now that we have Kosmos set up it's time to give the multi-cloud functionality a try. The process for this isn't much more that adding another node pool to the cluster but this time we need to select the "Multi-Cloud" type instead of "Scaleway" for our new pool.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![Adding a new multi-cloud node pool](/images/kosmos/AddPool.png)

<figcaption>Select the "Multi-Cloud" type</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the pool is created you can pick to "Add a node" which will provide you with instructions on how to register an external node with your Kosmos cluster.

It's worth noting here that currently only **Ubuntu 20.04** is supported as the host OS (20.10 currently fails with an `apparmor_parser` error) and the setup script needs to be run as root (I find it best to run the setup script from the init userdata if your cloud provider supports it).

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

<figcaption>The commands you need to run to register your new node</figcaption>
</figure>

### Adding an external node

For our first multi-cloud nodes I'm going to be using [Civo](https://civo.com/).

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![New node form in Civo](/images/kosmos/CivoNode.png)

<figcaption>Make sure you select an instance with at least 2Gb memory (not 1Gb as I have here) so you have enough for Kubelet</figcaption>
</figure>

The `multicloud-init.sh` script provided by Scaleway doesn't provide much in the way of progress updates and the external node can take quite a while before it shows up in kubectl so to keep an eye on anything going wrong I recommend taking a look at `journalctl -f` for your first nodes.

After a while your new nodes should pop up in kubectl.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![New Civo nodes showing in Kubectl](/images/kosmos/KubectlCivo.png)

<figcaption>You can now see two external nodes hosted with Civo (the cool-wilson pool)</figcaption>
</figure>

The init script doesn't currently provide any way of passing in node labels for Kubelet so to make things clearer I've manually added a `cloud` label to each node.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![Kubectl showing all nodes and their cloud label](/images/kosmos/CloudLabel.png)

<figcaption>Two Scaleway managed nodes and two Civo nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

While we're at it, lets add another cloud provider into the mix. This time I'm going to add a bare metal instance from [Equinix Metal](https://www.equinix.com/services/edge-services/equinix-metal).

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![Kubectl showing all nodes and their cloud label](/images/kosmos/KubectlEquinix.png)

<figcaption>As before I've manually added the node label</figcaption>
</figure>

Finally, let's add an on-premise instance to our cluster (or rather a virtual machine running on my Mac).

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![Kubectl showing all nodes and their cloud label](/images/kosmos/KubectlLocal.png)

<figcaption>As before I've manually added the node label</figcaption>
</figure>

We've now got a single Kubernetes cluster with worker nodes spread across (at least) 5 physical locations, 3 different cloud providers and a mix of different resource capabilities.

## Making use of the cluster

The main thing I wanted to test with this multi-cloud approach was how ingress handled pods being scheduled elsewhere. Turns out there's no surprises here. A LoadBalancer is created and hosted by Scaleway that then points to the appropriate Kuberentes Service resource which in turn points to the appropriate pod no matter where it happens to be scheduled.

It'd be good to do some more testing at some point on latency and network traffic costs to work out if this is a cost-effective approach or not. If anyone does dig into this more please do let me know!

## Some improvements needed

It's not all perfect, after all it is still an early beta.

I've already mentioned some of the limitations of the `multicloud-init.sh` script such as not being able to add node labels at creation time. These are fairly easy to work around though and likely to be supported in the future. The lack of progress visibility when adding a new external node is a bit of a pain when first trying out the service but not really an issue once you've got everything set up right.

One thing I did notice that wasn't ideal was if an external node is deleted in the external cloud the associated node resource in the cluster doesn't get removed and instead just changes to a "NotReady" status.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

![Kubectl showing a deleted node as NotReady](/images/kosmos/NotReady.png)

<figcaption>When I deleted one of the external instances the node remains in the NotReady state.</figcaption>
</figure>

This doesn't seem like a big deal at first but it does leave some pods in a pending state while they wait for the node to become ready again. If you're taking advantage of autoscaling of your external nodes this is likley to crop up fairly quickly and could cause unexpected issues.

The last issue I hit was when trying to add an ARM based machine (either a local Raspberry Pi or a cloud based ARM instance). The `multicloud-init.sh` script doesn't currently support architectures other than x86_64 _but_ a small tweak to the script and we can get an ARM node set up...

## Adding ARM support

To get ARM-based instances working we need to make a few changes to the `multicloud-init.sh` script provided by Scaleway. Below you can see the diff of the changes I used to get an ARM instance running on Equinix Metal.

```diff
7a8,12
> os_arch="amd64"
> if [[ "$(arch)" != "x86_64" ]]; then
>   os_arch="arm64"
> fi
>

---
>   if [[ "${os_arch}" == "amd64" ]]; then
>     apt-get install -y containerd.io > /dev/null 2>&1
>   else
>     apt-get install -y containerd > /dev/null 2>&1
>   fi

---
>   curl -L "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v${kubernetes_version}/bin/linux/${os_arch}/kubelet" \
```

This currently only works with 64-bit ARM instances (so not all Raspberry Pis) but it shouldn't take too much to expand it to correctly support more architectures. Hopefully Scaleway will provide support for ARM soon as we're seeing a lot of advances in ARM machines lately.

<figure class="center" markdown="1">

<figcaption>Our new ARM node</figcaption>
</figure>

There is still one small issue with ARM instances after using this modified script - the `node-problem-detector` DaemonSet used by Scaleway currently only targets x86 so will fail to run on our new ARM instance.

## Final Thoughts

Combining it with something like [cluster-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/) or [Gardener](https://github.com/gardener/gardener) could make the management of multi-cloud resources much more manageable.

Overall I'm pretty impressed with Kosmos so far, I think it has a lot of potential and I expect some of the other cloud providers will offer something similar eventually. It seems like a simpler alternative to Kubernetes federation when multi-tenancy isn't a requirement.
