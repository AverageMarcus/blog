If you ever find yourself needing to display a small icon for a 3rd party URL but don't want to have to crawl the site to pull out the favicon URL then you can make use of a Google CDN:

```
https://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=https://marcusnoble.co.uk/
```

Example: ![](https://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=https://marcusnoble.co.uk/)

You can even provide any page, not just the root URL.

e.g. `https://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=https://marcusnoble.co.uk/2020-11-10-t-i-l-how-to-get-the-favicon-of-any-site/`

![](https://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=https://marcusnoble.co.uk/2020-11-10-t-i-l-how-to-get-the-favicon-of-any-site/)
